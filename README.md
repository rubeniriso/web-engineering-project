This is a web application made for a BSc Computer Science's subject called "Web engineering".

This web application offers three key functionalities: checking the weather, taking notes, and adding notes to a calendar. Built with a focus on web accessibility, the app ensures that users of all abilities can easily navigate and interact with its features. Using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the frontend is developed in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to maintain a structured, modular, and responsive design. Users can quickly check real-time weather updates, create and manage notes, and organize important events by adding them to the integrated calendar for seamless planning.
